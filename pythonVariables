# Python has no command for declaring variables, a variable is created the moment you assign a value to it.

x = 5

#Variable have types
x = 4 # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str

#Casting
#Casting is to specify the data type of a variable
x = str(3) # x will be string or word '3'
y = int(3) # y will be number 3
z = float(3) # z will 3.0

#how to print the type
x = 5
y = "john"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
#Note: '' is the same as "" so "x" is the same as 'x'
#Case sensitivity 
a = 4
A = "Sally"
# A will not overwrite a

#Naming Variables:
#1 A variable name must start with a letter or underscore
#2 Avaliable name cannot start with a number
#3 A variable name are case sensitive
